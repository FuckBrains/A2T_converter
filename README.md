# A2T_converter

Welcome to A2T, the easy tool to transcribe audio information into text files. Did you ever hear an audiobook or watch a YouTube video and wished to be able to have a transcript of the spoken word? If the answer is yes, then this project might be helpful.  
You can transcribe short audio files, long audio files and even YouTube videos into text files, thereby ensuring that the spoken word is saved and can be reread later.
