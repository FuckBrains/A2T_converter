# A2T_converter

Welcome to A2T, the easily usable tool to transcribe audio information into text files. Did you ever hear an audiobook or watch a YouTube video and wished to be able to have a transcript of the spoken word? If the answer is yes, then this project might be helpful.  
You can transcribe short audio files, long audio files and even YouTube videos into text files, thereby ensuring that the spoken word is saved and can be reread later.

## Controls

The program is very intuitive. Just follow the command line instructions and you'll be fine.  
To quit the program at any time, press <kbd>Q</kbd> whenever a question is asked or click on the red 'X' in the upper right cmd window corner.  
If asked a question, reply by either pressing <kbd>Y</kbd> for 'yes', <kbd>N</kbd> for 'no', or <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit the program.  
To confirm the given answer, press <kbd>&#9166;</kbd>.  

## Hardware & Software Requirements

This program can be run without much computing power. It can be executed on any modern device and all major operating systems (Windows/ macOS/ Linux) fullfilling the software requirements.  
A2T is written in python and currently only available in the form of multiple python modules. Therefore, you need to download python in order to execute the program files (.py files). The required storage capacity depends on the user's behavior. It can range from a few MB when only transcribing small audio files to multiple GB when downloading and converting large video files.  
After downloading and storing this repository, open a python terminal window, navigate to the repository directory and type e.g. 'audio_2_text_la.py'. As soon as you hit <kbd>&#9166;</kbd>, the program will start.
